# Grant access to your webcam if it asks. Since access to the webcam requires
# https connection, you may get a warning (in Chrome):
# "Your connection is not private". I'm sure there is a way to set up a local
# certificate to avoid this warning. Instead, I have just been clicking
# "Advanced" -> "Proceed to <local host>"
```
